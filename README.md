# D-algebraic-functions
The file sourceNLDE is the source file of a Maple library (or package) called NLDE (NonLinear algebra and Differential Equations) 
currently for computing ODEs for compositions and rational expressions of D-algebraic functions.

The file NLDE-examples presents some examples of computations.

The file NLDE.mla is a library produced by the code in sourceNLDE.
