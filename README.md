# D-algebraic-functions
The file sourceNLDE is the source file of a Maple library (or package) called NLDE (NonLinear algebra and Differential Equations) 
currently for computing ODEs for compositions and rational expressions of D-algebraic functions.

The Jupyter file NLDE-examples.ipynb presents some examples of computations.

The file NLDE.mla is a library produced by the source code in sourceNLDE.mpl.

The accompanying paper, a joint work with Rida Ait El Manssour and Anna-Laura Sattelberger, is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02512.
